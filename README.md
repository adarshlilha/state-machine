# state-machine
A simple implementation of state machine in JS

Compliant with state machine rules from: https://statecharts.dev/what-is-a-state-machine.html

## Motivation
UI applications are becoming complex due to the growing number of state variables and difficulties to manage them

[XState](https://stately.ai/docs/xstate) is a state management lib to handle these logics in a state-machine paradigm

> this repo is a basic state machine implementation to understand how applications are driven inside a state-machine lib

## Running
`index.js` is a simple JS script which can be run in browser's console or Node (`node src/index.js`)
